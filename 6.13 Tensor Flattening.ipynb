    "‚úÖ Question: What happens if the chunk size does not evenly divide the tensor?\n",

    "‚úÖ Question: When should we use permute() instead of transpose()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Transpose only for changing column into rows for example it can change a 3x2 into 2x3, but permutes handles the arrangement differently, it can try any possible arrangement like reshaping the existing data, I think in real world image related techniques uses it a lot.\n",
